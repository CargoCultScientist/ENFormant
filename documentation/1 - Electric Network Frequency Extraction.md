Electrical Network Frequency #ENF analysis can be a valuable tool in Open Source Intelligence #OSINT for verifying the authenticity and determining the timing and location of audio and video recordings. Here's how it can be applied and some considerations:

### Ways ENF Analysis Can Be Used in OSINT

1. **Authenticating Recordings**: ENF can verify whether a recording is original or has been tampered with. Continuous and consistent ENF patterns suggest an unaltered recording, while breaks or inconsistencies might indicate editing or splicing.

2. **Timestamping**: By comparing the ENF pattern in a recording with known ENF data, analysts can estimate when the recording was made. This is particularly useful when the date and time of the recording are in question or disputed.

3. **Geolocation**: Different geographic regions have different power grid frequencies (e.g., 50 Hz in Europe, 60 Hz in North America). While ENF analysis is less precise for pinpointing an exact location, it can sometimes help narrow down the region where the recording was made. I was able to find at least three reasons for this: 
	1. first, energy networks are relatively exactly synchronized and variance in time is larger than variance in space (unverified assumption), 
	2. second, granularity of measurement points is sparse. we might have as little as two measurement stations per country to work with (England)
	3. some countries (Ukraine) do not have currently working measurement points

### Public Databases of ENF Values

- **National Grid Operators**: Some grid operators publish ENF data. For example, the UK's National Grid may provide this data for research purposes.
- **Academic and Research Institutions**: Researchers working on ENF analysis might share datasets in academic papers or public repositories.
- **Online Databases**: Websites like power-grid-frequency.org have been known to track and publish ENF data, although their availability and coverage can vary.

### Approaches for Providing Information about a Recording

1. **Timestamping and Geolocation Through ENF**:
   - **ENF Databases**: Accessing ENF databases for the time period in question is crucial. This might involve reaching out to grid operators or searching for publicly available datasets.
   - **Analysis Software**: Using software or algorithms capable of extracting ENF data from recordings and comparing it with the database.

2. **Other OSINT Techniques**:
   - **Metadata Analysis**: Examine file metadata for clues about the creation date, device used, and potentially the location (if GPS data is included).
   - **Background Sounds and Visuals**: Identifying background noise, language, accents, or landmarks can provide contextual clues.
   - **Social Media and News Correlation**: Cross-referencing the content with social media posts, news reports, and other public sources can help verify the time and location.

3. **Collaboration with Experts**:
   - **Forensic Analysts**: Professionals skilled in ENF and other forensic analyses can provide more precise insights.
   - **Community Engagement**: Platforms like Bellingcat involve a community of OSINT analysts who might offer additional insights or data sources.

### Limitations and Considerations

- **ENF Analysis Complexity**: The method requires technical expertise and access to the right tools and data.
- **Data Availability**: ENF databases are not universally available, and access might be restricted.
- **Potential for Manipulation**: Knowledgeable individuals could alter or fabricate ENF data in recordings.
- **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: The use of ENF analysis, especially in legal contexts, must adhere to privacy laws and ethical standards.

ENF analysis in OSINT is a powerful yet complex tool. It's most effective when combined with other investigative techniques and used within the framework of legal and ethical guidelines.

## ENF Tool

Developing software for ENF (Electrical Network Frequency) analysis involves several key steps, from planning and design to implementation and testing. Here's a structured plan to guide the development process:

## Proof-of-Concept Python tool (Plus)

Creating a proof of concept Python script for ENF analysis, focusing on core functionality, involves two main components: the audio processing module and the reference data matching module. Since Python offers robust libraries for audio processing, that part can be relatively straightforward. The challenge often lies in the reference data matching component. Let's break down these steps:

### 1. Audio Processing Module

You'll use Python libraries such as `librosa` or `scipy` for audio processing. This module will handle tasks like reading the audio file, downsampling (if necessary), and extracting the relevant frequency components (i.e., the mains hum).

Basic steps might include:
- Loading the audio file.
- Downsampling the audio to a lower sample rate to reduce computational load (optional but recommended for large files).
- Applying a bandpass filter to isolate the frequency band around the expected ENF (50 Hz or 60 Hz, depending on the region).

### 2. Reference Data Matching Module

This is the more complex part of the script. It involves comparing the extracted ENF data from the audio file with a reference database of known ENF values. The challenges here are obtaining the reference data and developing an algorithm to find the best match.

#### Obtaining Reference ENF Data:
- Contact national grid operators or academic institutions for historical ENF data.
- Search for publicly available datasets or consider recording your own ENF data as a baseline (though this is less practical for historical analysis).

#### Developing the Matching Algorithm:
1. **Format the ENF Data**: Ensure both the extracted ENF data and the reference data are in a comparable format (e.g., a time series of frequency measurements).

2. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - Implement a time series comparison algorithm. This could be as simple as a correlation analysis or more complex like dynamic time warping, depending on the accuracy required and the nature of your data.
   - Calculate a similarity score for each segment of the reference data compared to your extracted ENF data.

3. **Finding the Best Match**:
   - Slide your extracted ENF data window over the reference dataset, computing similarity at each step.
   - Identify the time segment in the reference data that has the highest similarity score to your extracted data.

4. **Handling Noise and Variability**:
   - Implement methods to handle noise and variability in the ENF signal. This might include smoothing techniques or more sophisticated signal processing methods.

5. **Result Interpretation**:
   - Provide a way to interpret the results, like a confidence score or a potential time range.

### Python Libraries to Consider

- **For Audio Processing**: `librosa`, `scipy`, `numpy`.
- **For Time Series Analysis**: `pandas` for data handling, `scipy` or `statsmodels` for statistical analysis.

### Example Pseudocode

```python
import librosa
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.signal import butter, filtfilt

# Load and process audio
audio_file = 'path_to_file.wav'
audio, sr = librosa.load(audio_file, sr=None)  # Load with native sample rate
audio_downsampled = librosa.resample(audio, sr, 300)  # Optional downsampling

# Bandpass Filter for ENF extraction
def bandpass_filter(signal, lowcut, highcut, fs, order=5):
    nyquist = 0.5 * fs
    low = lowcut / nyquist
    high = highcut / nyquist
    b, a = butter(order, [low, high], btype='band')
    y = filtfilt(b, a, signal)
    return y

enf_signal = bandpass_filter(audio_downsampled, 49.8, 50.2, 300)

# Extract ENF data - Implement FFT or STFT here as needed

# Load Reference ENF Data
reference_data = pd.read_csv('path_to_reference_data.csv')

# Time Series Analysis and Matching
# - Implement time series comparison (e.g., correlation analysis)
# - Slide the window of extracted ENF data over the reference dataset
# - Calculate similarity scores and find the best match

# Interpret and output results
```

This pseudocode provides a basic structure for your proof of concept. Actual implementation will require more detailed coding, especially in extracting ENF data from the audio signal and performing the time series analysis for matching.

The variability of Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) over space is an important consideration in ENF analysis. Here are the key aspects:
You're correct in pointing out a potential limitation of using moment-to-moment correlation, specifically Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient (PMCC), in ENF analysis. PMCC measures the linear correlation between two datasets, indicating how well the relationship between the datasets can be described using a linear equation. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the absolute values of the two datasets are closely matched, which is a crucial aspect in ENF analysis.

### Key Points:

1. **Correlation vs. Agreement:**
   - PMCC is effective in showing how well two datasets move together, i.e., whether they have a similar pattern or trend.
   - However, two datasets can be highly correlated even if their absolute values differ significantly. This is because PMCC is sensitive to the shape of the dataset, not the scale.
   - For instance, two time series could have a high PMCC if they both show a similar upward trend over time, even if one consistently has much higher values than the other.

2. **Implications for ENF Analysis:**
   - In ENF analysis, the goal is often to match the exact frequency values over time, not just the trend. This is because the ENF should not only follow a similar pattern but also have similar absolute values at corresponding times.
   - Using PMCC alone might lead to false positives where the pattern of frequency changes matches, but the actual frequency values are different.

3. **Possible Solutions:**
   - **Absolute Value Comparison:** Implement a method to compare the absolute values of the ENF data, perhaps alongside PMCC. This could involve calculating the difference between corresponding points in the two datasets and assessing how often these differences fall within an acceptable range.
   - **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):** Use RMSE to measure the average magnitude of the errors between pairs of observed and predicted values. Lower RMSE values indicate a better match in absolute terms.
   - **Cross-Correlation:** Instead of PMCC, consider using cross-correlation, which can give a better sense of how well two signals match up in terms of both shape and magnitude.
   - **Combined Metrics:** Consider a hybrid approach that uses both correlation and absolute value comparison to determine the best match. This could provide a more accurate and reliable method for ENF matching.

4. **Contextual and Supplementary Analysis:**
   - It's often beneficial to combine ENF analysis with other types of contextual information (like geographical data, if available) to strengthen the reliability of the conclusions drawn.

By addressing these concerns in your ENF analysis, you can enhance the accuracy and reliability of your system, making it more effective for practical applications such as forensic analysis or timestamp verification.


### 1. **Spatial Stability of ENF:**

- **Grid Synchronization**: Generally, power grids are highly synchronized. This means that at any given moment, the frequency of the electrical network is nearly the same throughout the entire grid. For instance, the entire UK grid or the Eastern Interconnection in the US operates synchronously.
- **Local Variations**: While the overall grid frequency is synchronized, local variations can occur due to several factors like local load changes, generation changes, or network topology. However, these variations are usually minor.
- **Distance from Measurement Point**: At distances of 10km or 100km from a measuring station, it is highly likely that the ENF would still be representative of the grid frequency. The spatial granularity of ENF variations is generally much larger than these distances, especially in well-integrated power grids.

### 2. **Factors Affecting ENF Stability:**

- **Grid Size and Integration**: Larger and more integrated grids tend to have less variability over space. For example, in a large interconnected grid like that in Europe or North America, the frequency is quite uniform across vast distances.
- **Point of Measurement**: The type of location (e.g., near industrial areas, residential areas, or power stations) might influence local ENF characteristics due to the types of loads or generation sources.
- **Grid Configuration**: Some countries have multiple grid systems (e.g., Japan), which can have different frequencies or characteristics.

### 3. **Implications for ENF Analysis:**

- **Reliability Over Distance**: For most practical purposes, especially in densely populated or well-integrated grid areas, ENF recorded in a location should closely match the ENF at a grid's reference measurement point even if they are tens or hundreds of kilometers apart.
- **Consideration of Local Effects**: In cases where precise timestamping is critical, it may be worth considering local grid configurations and potential sources of electrical noise that could slightly alter the ENF.

### 4. **Use in Forensic Analysis:**

- **General Timestamping**: For general timestamping purposes, ENF data from central grid measurements are usually sufficient to match recordings made within the same grid area.
- **High-Precision Applications**: For very high-precision applications (e.g., forensic evidence in court cases), a detailed understanding of local grid dynamics might be necessary.

### Conclusion:

In summary, while there are some minor local variations in ENF, the frequency is largely consistent across a power grid at any given moment. Recordings made within the same grid, even at distances of 100km from the reference measurement station, are likely to contain ENF data that matches the grid frequency. However, for extremely precise applications, local grid characteristics and variations might need to be taken into account.
